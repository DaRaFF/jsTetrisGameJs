# jsTetris
Do you love Tetris? I do!

This is a Tetris prototype implemented with gamejs game engine.

It's an educational implementation for myself and I try to learn some basic concepts
of game programming and HTML5 Canvas element.

## local development

Because of CORS issues, you need to start a small webserver in you local development folder, e.g.
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. No you can test the game at http://localhost:8000 (no hot reload)
